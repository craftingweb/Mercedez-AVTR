VISION AVTR design – the epitome of environmental friendliness

The innovative concept of VISION AVTR combines an eco-friendly interaction between interior, exterior and UX design. The entire design process was focused on a specific result - a unique experience of interaction and perception of the concept car by the driver and passengers. It was about creating a unique space in which passengers have a biometric connection with each other, with the vehicle and the outside world.

The side outer opening extends through the inside and creates an endless loop, inspired by the sacred connection between the Na'vi people in the film Avatar and their natural habitat.

Also, with its elongated “One Bow” design and organic design philosophy, the VISION AVTR represents a radical new stage in automotive technology. Thus, going from the concept of mindfulness to the unique fusion of man and car, Mercedes-Benz engineers succeeded in creating the VISION AVTR concept electric vehicle.: https://mercedez.vercel.app/
